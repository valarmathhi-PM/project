    <h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>
    <p>Web development is the process of building, maintaining, and creating websites for the internet or intranets. It involves a range of tasks, including coding, design, and performance. Web development is often broken down into three main types: front-end, back-end, and full-stack. 
        Here are some key aspects of web development:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            Front-end: Focuses on the user-facing side of a website, including the user interface (UI) and visual elements.
    Back-end: Focuses on the server-side functionality, including databases, logic, APIs, and servers.
</li>
        
        <li>
            Full-stack: Involves both front-end and back-end development.
            Database management: Involves storing and handling databases to ensure data is managed effectively.
            Web design: Focuses on the design and functionality of a website, primarily to enhance the user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
            Maintenance and updates: Involves fixing bugs, updating features, and ensuring security. 
            Web developers use a variety of coding languages, depending on the tasks and platforms they are working on. Some key soft skills for web developers include multitasking, self-motivation, organizational skills, attention to detail, and communication.

    <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and web development</h2>
        <h4>Origin/ Web 1.0</h4>
        Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN.[5]
        
        The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, HTML was developed in 1993.[6]
        
        
        <h4>Web 2.0</h4>
        Web 2.0, a term popularised by Dale Dougherty, then vice president of O'Reilly, during a 2004 conference with Media Live, marks a shift in internet usage, emphasizing interactivity.[9][10]
        
        Web 2.0 introduced increased user engagement and communication. 
       
       <h4> Web 3.0</h4>
        Web 3.0, considered the third and current version of the web, was introduced in 2014. 
       <h3> Evolution of web development technologies</h3>
        The journey of web development technologies began with simple HTML pages in the early days of the internet. Over time, advancements led to the incorporation of CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. This evolution transformed static websites into dynamic and responsive platforms, setting the stage for the complex and feature-rich web applications we have today.
        <ul>
       <li>Static HTML Pages (1990s)</li>
        <li> Introduction of CSS (late 1990s)[13]</li>
        <li> JavaScript and Dynamic HTML (1990s - early 2000s)[14][15]</li>
        <li>AJAX (1998)[16]</li>
        <li>Rise of Content management systems (CMS) (mid-2000s)</li>
        <li>Mobile web (late 2000s - 2010s)</li>
        <li>Single-page applications (SPAs) and front-end frameworks (2010s)</li>
        <li>Server-side javaScript (2010s)</li>
        <li> Microservices and API-driven development (2010s - present)</li>
        <li> Progressive web apps (PWAs) (2010s - present)</li>
        <li> JAMstack Architecture (2010s - present)</li>
        <li> WebAssembly (Wasm) (2010s - present)</li>
        <li>Serverless computing (2010s - present)</li>
        <li>  AI and machine learning integration (2010s - present)</li>
    </ul>
        Web development in future will be driven by advances in browser technology, Web internet infrastructure, protocol standards, software engineering methods, and application trends.[8]
